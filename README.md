Just... whoa. I just left the theater and Pabrik Gula is still spinning my mind like a cotton candy machine, you know? I swear, my back feels as knotted as that long scene with the sugarcane fields, stretching forever. Couldn't get comfortable in those seats, felt like sitting on bumpy sidewalks. Random popcorn attacked me during the intense parts, but somehow I didn’t care. Honestly, it feels like I'm tasting sugarcane on my tongue right now.

The opening sequence—so vivid, it punched through the screen. Felt like tactile nostalgia. But then my seat creaked and broke the mood like a nosey aunt at a family dinner. The noise in the theater? A constant murmur. The scene where the factory looms in that ghostly light—shivers, seriously. It’s like the full moon decided to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   too. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , remember you said, right?

> That moment in the middle when everything slows and you witness those hands grinding down sugar crystals? I tried appreciating the details, but my mind got sidetracked by the howling AC, blowing directly into my face like an artificial winter. It kinda synced with the laborious grind of the storyline, almost like too many teaspoons of sugar dissolving in tea but never quite sweetening it the way you hoped.

Characters? Oh! Like leaves swept by the factory winds, some stick and some just swirl away, you know? I think my brain tried processing too much at once—spotting allegories while checking if I had butter stains on my shirt.

Oh, when Baba said that thing about tradition! Damn. It was like he spoke directly to someone’s soul while the rest of us eavesdropped. Does that make sense? Though by then, my brain was yearning for a pause button— s do have those, not life.

Anyway, they really should improve their seat cushioning though, like a quest or something—find the softest seat, maybe before people decide to just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   at home with fluffy cushions and quieter crunches.

All this, it's like attempting to fold a fitted sheet; looks good in theory, but somehow it’s awkward yet satisfying in a twisted way. Thinking if I should go again... maybe not. But it’s got that something that calls you back, like a catchy song you hate to love?
